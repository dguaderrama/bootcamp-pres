## Relational Operations

Sets of methods used to test for the existence of a specified topological spatial relationship between two geometric objects as they would be represented on a map. 

The basic approach to comparing two geometric objects is to project the objects onto the 2D horizontal coordinate reference system representing the Earth's surface, and then make pair-wise tests of the intersections between the interiors, boundaries and exteriors of the twp projections and to classify the map relationship between the two geometric objects based on the entries in the resulting 3 by 3 intersection matrix.
