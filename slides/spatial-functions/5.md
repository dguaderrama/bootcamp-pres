## Outline of Spatial Predicates

### Equals

#### The two geometric objects are spatially equal meaning, they represent the same geometry (congruent in geometric terms)

### Disjoint

#### The two geometric objects share no points in common, the two objects are completely separate

### Intersects

#### The two geometric objects have at least one point in common

### Touches

#### The two geometric objects have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points

### Crosses

#### The two geometric objects share some but not all interior points
