## Outline of Spatial Predicates (cont.)

### Contains

#### One geometry is contained by the other if all the points of one geometry are within the boundary or interior of the other and they share at least one interior point. This means that this predicate may produce unpredictable behavior for linestrings and points which have no interior points.2

### Within

#### The inverse of Contains. The first geometry is completely within the second geometry

### Overlaps

#### The two geometries share some but not all points in common, the two geometries have the same dimensions and the intersection of the two geometries has the same dimension as the two input geometries

### Covers

#### Similar to contains, but does not require that the two geometries share an interior point, which makes it the proper tool for working with inputs of different dimensions.
