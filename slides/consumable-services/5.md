OpeNDAP, the original developer of the Data Access Protocol, allows users to access data over the internet4. OPeNDAP software requests data through URL. OPeNDAP services allow users to query and subset datasets that would be too large to download/manipulate locally. There are a variety of software programs that are OPeNDAP enabled, which allows users to combine local and remote data for visualizations.
